# Library

&#128218;<a href='https://dustydogcodex.github.io/Library/'>LIVE DEMO</a>&#128218; 

For this project I will be creating a webpage that acts as a "library". Users can enter information regarding the books like name of book, author, number of pages in the book and whether or not they have read the book. This information is stored as an object inside an array using local storage. Throught this project I learned:

1) How to get items from and store items into local storage using localStorage.getItem() and localStorage.setItem)().
2) How to work with JSON methods (JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()) to read and pass items to local storage.
3) The advantages of using JavaScript Classes to create object constructors that help in creating similar objects over and over again.
4) Event propogation to use user interactions with the DOM to add or remove elements from the DOM as well as from localStorage.
5) Using bootstrap to add styling to default JavaScript alert boxes.
6) Using the concept of closure to build classes that can access results from other methods/classes without accessing their local variables.

This was a fun but hard project for me. I got stuck multiple times while working with localStorage+JSON and especially with using event propagation to identify which elements to remove. I'm glad I stuck thorugh the project because working through it really helped me improve my skills in these areas.
